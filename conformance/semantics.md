# Ordering semantics

Status: draft for 0.1. Every Tessera implementation (Rust now, C++ later) follows these rules and is tested against the shared vectors in `conformance/vectors/` once they exist.

## Sort contracts

| Contract | Guarantee |
|---|---|
| Stable | The output is ordered by key, and records with equal keys appear in their input order. |
| Unstable | The output is ordered by key. The order of records with equal keys is unspecified. |

Release 0.1 provides the stable contract only. The unstable contract is reserved for a dedicated unstable kernel in a later release.

Both contracts output a permutation of the input: no record is lost, duplicated or modified, whatever the key function returns.

## Key extraction

- The key function may be called any number of times per record, in any order.
- During one sort, it should return the same key for the same record. If it does not, the order of the result is unspecified, but the output is still a permutation of the input and no undefined behavior occurs.
- If the key function panics (Rust) or throws (C++), the error propagates to the caller. The slice then holds every record exactly once, in an unspecified order.

## Key encoding

Each supported key maps to an unsigned integer of the same width. Records are ordered by that integer.

| Key type | Encoding |
|---|---|
| Unsigned integers | Unchanged |
| Signed integers | The sign bit is flipped |
| `f32`, `f64` | If the sign bit is set, all bits are inverted; otherwise only the sign bit is flipped. This matches Rust's `total_cmp`. |
| 128-bit integers | Compared as a high 64-bit half, then a low 64-bit half. Signed 128-bit keys flip the sign bit of the high half. |
| `Reverse<K>` | All bits of the encoding of `K` are inverted |

### Consequences for floats

The resulting order is: negative NaNs, `-inf`, negative numbers, `-0.0`, `+0.0`, positive numbers, `+inf`, positive NaNs. NaNs of the same sign are ordered by payload.

Applications that need all NaNs to compare equal, or `-0.0` equal to `+0.0`, should normalize the key in the key function, for example by mapping every NaN to one canonical NaN and `-0.0` to `+0.0`.

### Descending order

Descending order is expressed by reversing the key, not by reversing an ascending result. Reversing the result would also reverse the order of equal keys and break stability.

## Space

Implementations document three quantities separately:

1. the scratch memory one call needs;
2. fixed-size storage on the stack;
3. capacity a reusable workspace retains between calls.

A workspace reuses capacity only. Every call re-establishes which scratch records are live; bytes left by an earlier call are never treated as records. Sorting with a workspace produces the same result as the corresponding free function, and a workspace stays usable after a key function panics.
